        <h1>Walking Your Path</h1>
        <p>
        Congrats! You’ve decided to embrace the world of education. I am so proud of you.
         Think about how incredible this moment is. You’re about to undergo a life-changing 
         event, so make sure you remember this moment well.
        I’m going to be honest, it’s going to be intimidating. 
        I came from a reservation to a city, so not only did 
        I have to deal with understanding how to manage college life, 
        but I also had to adjust to living in a city with people from diverse 
        backgrounds. It can be lonely, so make sure you have a steady person with 
        whom you can connect. If you want in-person support, look to see if your 
        school offers an indigenous connection program. But I know you’ve got this, 
        I mean, look at how far you’ve come right now. 
        </p>
        <h2>Your Path</h2>
        <p>Below, you will find a suggested timeline for completing important items 
            needed for your school. This list may not include everything, or it may 
            differ entirely from your school's, so be sure to monitor your emails, 
            incoming phone calls, and text messages closely. As soon as you are expected 
            to attend, many people behind the scenes are working together to ensure you 
            have a smooth start at their college. </p>
