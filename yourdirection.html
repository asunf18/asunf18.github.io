        ahead. Throughout our culture, we’re consistently reminded of our people’s resilience.
            How our ancestors overcame many incredible obstacles, persevered, and, through their
            sacrifices, we now stand here with the freedom to choose what we want our lives to
            be. <br>By choosing to pursue education, you’ve chosen a path to align yourself with 
            the stars, the earth, and the sky. To regain balance and explore a new level of 
            understanding about what it means to be an indigenous person in today’s world. 
            If you’re still unsure, that’s ok. It’s a big step, and if this is your first time 
            researching it, it might feel overwhelming at first. Just remember that you are an 
            extension of those who came before you. When you need it most, just channel that 
            strength to help guide you.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details class ="faq-item">
        <summary><strong>What is FAFSA?</strong></summary>
            <p>
            Every year, a form is released called FAFSA. It asks for your family’s financial information. 
            Think of it as taking a snapshot of your family’s current spending and income habits. 
            This form is then sent to a group of people who determine how much college they think you can afford based on those details.
            </p>
            <p>
            This affordability number is then sent to your school. This number determines a variety of factors, 
            such as scholarships, grants, and work-study programs for which you may be eligible.
            </p>
        </details>
         <details>
        <summary><strong>How do I afford college?</strong></summary>
            <p>
            That’s a big question, and it can be extremely intimidating, but don’t worry—you have options.
            </p>
                <h4>Tribal Colleges and Partnerships</h4>
                <p>
                Many colleges offer free tuition options for members of a federally recognized tribe. 
                There are community colleges and universities that specialize in tribal connections and 
                ensuring your experiences allow you the best of both worlds. Tuition can either be discounted or fully covered.
                </p>
                <h4>Scholarships</h4>
                <p>
                One option is scholarships. There are scholarship portals where you provide details about yourself, 
                and then you are matched with possible scholarships for which you are eligible. 
                Scholarships are awarded based on a variety of factors: merit (like your GPA or test scores), 
                charity/volunteer experience, leadership projects, and your major.
                </p>
                <p>
                These applications typically involve filling out forms with your personal details, essays, photos, 
                and proof of a required document (if applicable).
                </p>
        </details>

        <summary><strong>How do I start?</strong></summary>
        <p>
        Choose a school. Where do you want to go? In-state students typically pay lower 
        tuition compared to out-of-state students. Don’t forget to check out tribal colleges and 
        universities, as they often provide help with tuition costs. Don’t get overwhelmed, 
        you’ll figure the rest out later. Starting here will keep you focused on the goal. 
        There are a lot of questions you need to have answered, and a lot of them will be based
         on the school you’re going to choose. Once the school has been decided, you can proceed
          to the next step and visit the Walking the Path page for additional assistance.
