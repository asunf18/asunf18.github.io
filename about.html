        <p>
            Welcome, and thank you for being here. My name is Nika, and I am of the Red Running Into the Water
            people, born for the Sleeping Rock people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Growing up, college felt like something I only saw in movies—study montages, dorm rooms, and then
            suddenly a graduation. I knew college existed, but I didn’t know how I would exist in it. No one in
            my family had gone, and I didn’t have anyone to ask. It wasn’t until a supportive teacher helped me
            with applications, fee waivers, and essays that I realized higher education could be within reach.
        </p>

        <p>
            But even after I was accepted, I didn’t know what to do next. Deadlines passed, and I quietly
            stepped away because I felt overwhelmed and unsure of where to begin. Eventually, someone encouraged
            me to try community college. So I did—one class at a time, whenever I could afford it. I learned how
            to navigate the campus, how to ask questions, and how to persevere.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fourteen years later, I earned my associate’s degree. Today, I’m a senior at ASU working toward my
            bachelor’s, a first-generation student, and an auntie who helps guide my nieces and nephews on their
            own paths. Now, I hope to help you with yours.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you grew up on the reservation, you know what it means to be resilient, resourceful, and
            determined. We come from a nation within a nation, and understanding the world outside our borders
            helps us move forward without being left behind.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope this website provides you with clarity, comfort, and confidence as you begin your journey.
            Ahéhee’ for visiting.
